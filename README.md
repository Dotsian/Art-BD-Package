# Ballsdex Art Package (BETA)

The BallsDex art package is a custom package developed by `dot_zz` on Discord that simulates Ballsdex's art revamp acception system in their official servers.

As of now, the BallsDex art package only supports spawn art revamps.

## Commands

* `b.updateart` - Updates all art in a ForumChannel to the current versions of that collectible's art.
* `b.acceptart` - Updates a collectible's art live and accepts it using a message link.
